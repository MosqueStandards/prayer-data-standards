# Prayer Time Data Standards for Mosques

## Status
DRAFT

## Introduction
In the age of digital communication and integration, accurate and easily accessible prayer time data is essential for mosques and Muslim communities worldwide. The diversity in methods and formats for sharing this data has led to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. By establishing a unified **Prayer Time Data Standard**, we can ensure that prayer times are shared reliably and consistently across different platforms and applications, benefiting developers, communities, and individuals alike.

## Types of Data in Prayer Time Standards

To create a comprehensive and flexible system for sharing prayer times, it's important to define the types of data that need to be standardized. Common types of data include:

- **Prayer Times**: The five daily prayers (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha), along with special timings like **Jumu'ah (Friday prayer)** and **Qiyam (optional night prayers)**.
- **Calculation Method**: The method used to calculate the prayer times (e.g., Umm al-Qura, ISNA, MWL). Various regions and mosques may follow different methods based on Islamic jurisprudence.
- **Location Information**: Precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) and the corresponding time zone to ensure accurate local prayer times.
- **Date and Time Formats**: A standardized format for dates (e.g., ISO 8601) and times (e.g., 24-hour vs. 12-hour format) to avoid confusion across different systems.
- **Adjustments**: Local or seasonal adjustments, such as daylight savings or mosque-specific modifications.
- **Hijri/Gregorian Date Mapping**: A way to synchronize the Islamic calendar with the Gregorian calendar for accurate event and prayer time integration.

## The Importance of an Open Standard

An open standard for prayer time data is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Interoperability**: Different apps, websites, and devices use prayer time data for a variety of purposes, from displaying daily prayer times to sending notifications. A common standard ensures that all these platforms can communicate seamlessly, providing consistent and reliable information to users.
   
2. **Accuracy**: Errors in calculation methods or formatting discrepancies can lead to incorrect prayer times being displayed, causing confusion for the community. Standardization minimizes these errors by ensuring that data is always formatted and shared correctly.

3. **Ease of Integration**: For developers, an open standard reduces the complexity of integrating prayer time data into their systems. Whether they are building mosque apps, prayer time websites, or smart device applications, a standard API or data format ensures they can easily plug in the data they need without having to account for different formats.

4. **Accessibility**: Open standards allow mosques of all sizes, including those with limited technical resources, to share their prayer times widely and efficiently. By following the same rules, smaller mosques can have their data integrated into global prayer time networks, making it easier for their communities to stay informed.

5. **Scalability and Future Growth**: As technology evolves, new platforms and devices will emerge that will also require access to prayer time data. An open standard ensures that prayer times can be easily adopted and used across future technologies, from smartwatches to voice-activated assistants.

6. **Global Consistency**: A unified data standard ensures that prayer times, no matter where they are in the world, follow the same structure. This allows users to have a consistent experience across different regions, platforms, and applications.

## Benefits of Following a Unified Standard

- **Enhanced Community Experience**: A consistent, reliable way to access prayer times fosters a more connected and informed Muslim community.
  
- **Simplified Data Sharing**: Mosques can easily share prayer times across various platforms, reaching their congregation more efficiently.
  
- **Open Source Collaboration**: With an open standard, developers can contribute to and improve the system, ensuring it adapts to future needs while remaining inclusive for all communities.
  
- **Reduced Duplication**: Instead of each mosque or organization developing its own system, everyone benefits from a shared infrastructure, reducing development time and costs.

## Project Outcomes

At the completion of this project, we will provide several key resources to facilitate the adoption and integration of the **Prayer Time Data Standard**:

### 1. **Standardized CSV Format**
   We will offer a standardized **CSV format** that can be used by mosques to easily export and share their prayer times. This format will include essential fields such as:

   - Mosque name
   - Location (latitude, longitude, time zone)
   - Prayer times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha)
   - Jumu'ah prayer times
   - Any local adjustments (e.g., for daylight savings)

   This CSV format can be uploaded to websites, shared with mobile apps, or integrated into mosque management systems.

### 2. **JSON Document Schema**
   A **JSON schema** will be made available for more structured data transfer, which is ideal for web services, APIs, and mobile applications. The schema will include fields for:
   
   - Location information
   - Calculation method
   - Daily prayer times (with metadata for precision)
   - Hijri/Gregorian date correlation
   - Adjustments for time zones or custom prayer time shifts

   The JSON schema ensures that developers can easily parse and integrate prayer time data across various platforms with consistency.

### 3. **API Documentation**
   We will also provide documentation for a standardized **Prayer Time API**, allowing mosques to broadcast their prayer times in real-time. The API will follow RESTful principles and support both JSON and XML formats, making it versatile for different development needs.

### 4. **Online Validator Tool**
   We will also provide an **online validator** tool that allows mosques and developers to upload their prayer time data (in CSV or JSON formats) and check whether it complies with the standard. This will help ensure that data is accurate, well-formatted, and ready for distribution across platforms.

## Conclusion

Incorporating and adopting a **Prayer Time Data Standard** is essential for ensuring that the correct prayer times are delivered consistently across platforms, benefiting mosques, developers, and the wider Muslim community. By embracing an open standard, we can build a more connected and unified ecosystem that supports technological growth while preserving the accuracy and integrity of Islamic practices.

The tools and resources provided at the end of this project will simplify integration, encourage widespread adoption, and ensure that mosques of all sizes can easily share their prayer times in a reliable and consistent manner.
